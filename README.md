# 📣 Feedback System Module – Collaborative Task

Welcome to the `collegesecracy-collaborative-work` repo! This task involves designing and implementing a **modular Feedback System** that will be later integrated into the `Mentee Dashboard` of the main project.

---

## 📌 Objective

Create a **fully functional Feedback System** consisting of:
- 🔧 Frontend UI for mentees to submit feedback
- 🔐 A separate `authStore` for this module (for learning isolation)
- 🔁 Backend APIs for submitting and viewing feedback
- 🔄 Proper route integration
- 💾 MongoDB for storing feedback

This system will be plugged into the `MenteeDashboard` later.

---

## 🖼️ Where It Fits

The component you’re building will be added to:

```jsx
// Inside MenteeDashboard.jsx

{/* Feedback Section - place your component here */}
<FeedbackSection />
